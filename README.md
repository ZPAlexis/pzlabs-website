This repository serves as a dual-purpose project: my personal portfolio & blog website and a dynamic "web laboratory" for experimenting with front-end technologies. 

Initially built with HTML and CSS, it will progressively incorporate JavaScript functionalities, showcasing my journey and skills in web development.

## About the Project

This project is more than just a static portfolio; it's a living sandbox where I explore, learn, and implement various front-end concepts. The core idea is to continuously evolve the website, adding new features, animations, and interactive elements as I expand my knowledge in web development.

Currently, the project focuses on:

* **Responsive Design:** Ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.
* **Clean HTML Structure:** Building semantic and accessible web pages.
* **Modern CSS Techniques:** Utilizing Flexbox, Grid, custom properties, and animations.

Future iterations will delve into:

* **JavaScript Interactivity:** Dynamic content loading, form validation, API integrations, and more.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and visual presentation.
* **JavaScript (Planned):** For adding interactivity and dynamic features.

## Features

### Planned Features:

* **Responsive Layout:** Adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Navigation Menu:** Easy access to different sections of the portfolio.
* **Project Showcase:** Dedicated section to display my work (with placeholders for project details).
* **About Me Section:** A brief introduction.
* **Blog Functionality:** Blog posts, tags, and lists.
* **Laguage Toggle:** User-preference language switching.
* **Dark Mode Toggle:** User-preference based theme switching.
* **Authentication & API Integration:** The third phase of the project, including user authentication, and data for future app projects.

## Roadmap

This project is a continuous work in progress. Here's a general roadmap of planned enhancements:

* **Phase 1 (Current):** HTML structure, basic CSS styling, responsive layout.
* **Phase 2:** Implement core JavaScript functionalities and Blogging section.
* **Phase 3:** Advanced JavaScript features (e.g., API integration, complex animations).
* **Phase 4:** Authentication and user related features.

I aim to regularly push updates and document the learning process.
