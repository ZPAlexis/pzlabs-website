## About the Project

This project is more than just a static portfolio; it's a living sandbox where I explore, learn, and implement various front-end concepts. The core idea is to continuously evolve the website, adding new features, animations, and interactive elements as I expand my knowledge in web development.

Currently, the project focuses on:

* **Responsive Design:** Ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. ![Complete Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Complete-25c2a0)
