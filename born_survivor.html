        <h2 class="post-heading" id="objective">Objective</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Born Survivor was a quick experiment with the objective of learning the complexities involved in developing interesting game mechanics. In this case we implemented a “Pick 1 of 3” rogue-like style mechanic to uncover the complexities and potential for future usage in other projects. The end goal was not to release a fully developed game, but just an experience that accomplished this  objective.</p>
        <a href="images/projects/born_survivor/Portfolio_Cover_StartScreen_BornSurvivor.jpg"><img class="post-image shadow" src="images/projects/born_survivor/Portfolio_Cover_StartScreen_BornSurvivor.jpg"></a>
        <p class="post-text">A “Pick 1 of 3” rogue-like mechanic is a recent trend popularized by the game Vampire Survivors. It presents the user with the opportunity to choose one in three choices that get randomly selected from a long list of power-ups. The randomized nature creates an almost infinite level of variety to each gameplay session and gives additional longevity to the whole experience.</p>

        <p class="post-text">Born Survivor is a game where the player needs to survive for as long as possible while increasingly difficult waves of enemies are spawned every few seconds.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The player moves around a pre-defined map, killing each enemy by striking them with an attack and staying away from their reach.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Experience gems are dropped on the ground from defeated enemies and can be collected by the player, granting a level whenever enough experience gems have been collected.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Each level gained stops the game to give the player the ability to pick 1 of 3 different power-up options. These options include a variety of improvements to the player’s abilities, such as increased damage for attacks, running speed, and life.</p>
        <p class="post-text">By combining different power options this specific mechanic provides a vast range of combinations, keeping the experience fresh and exciting for a longer time.</p>

        <p class="post-text">After learning the basics with the first game, Unity provided the quickest way to develop the mechanics proposed by this project. It was a great opportunity to test some of the limitations with the amount of enemies instantiated at the same time.</p>

        <p class="post-text">The logic diagram is a summarized representation of the controlling scripts attached to Unity’s game objects. As a simple experiement, this project’s focus was mainly on the correct implementation of the power-up controller and it’s relation to other scripts. The main complexity was around creating a player controller that is influenced by the power-ups choosen by the user.</p>
        <p class="post-text">While our first project kept a lean file structure, this time the “Pick 1 of 3” design and Unity’s game object structure forced the creation of a separate script files for each PowerUp.</p>
        <a href="images/projects/born_survivor/Portfolio_BornSurvivor_FolderStructure.png"><img class="post-image half center shadow" src="images/projects/born_survivor/Portfolio_BornSurvivor_FolderStructure.png"></a>
        <p class="post-text">Here is a brief snippet from PowerUp_DamagePercent.cs to showcase how the player data was manipulated.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Increase Player Damage Percentage Snippet
  target.GetComponent<PlayerController>().data.attackDMG *= (1 + (amount/100));
        </code></pre>
        <p class="post-text">This next script is from PowerUpPool.cs. This logic randomly chooses three power ups from the available list and generates the game objects as options for the user to choose from with the GeneratePowerUpOptions function.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Powerup Options Generation Snippet
public void GeneratePowerUpOptions() {
  List<int> list = new List<int>();
  for(int i = 0; i < powerUpList.Count; i++)
  {
      list.Add(i);
  }
  
  int rand1 = Random.Range(0, list.Count);
  int value1 = list[rand1];
  list.RemoveAt(rand1);
  InstantiatePowerUp(value1, choice1, cardPrefab, gameObject.transform);

  int rand2 = Random.Range(0, list.Count);
  int value2 = list[rand2];
  list.RemoveAt(rand2);
  InstantiatePowerUp(value2, choice2, cardPrefab, gameObject.transform);

  int rand3 = Random.Range(0, list.Count);
  int value3 = list[rand3];
  list.RemoveAt(rand3);
  InstantiatePowerUp(value3, choice3, cardPrefab, gameObject.transform);
}
        </code></pre>

        <p class="post-text">Born Survivor did not have any specific visual design system requirements. Since the objective focused on the power-up system, all visual design decisions and art assets were gathered from freely available sources including the Unity’s Asset Store.</p>

        <p class="post-text">This project had a much narrower focus than our first venture into game dev with Flappy Astronaut. While our first foray was aimed at understanding the complexities of the whole process, this time we wanted to zoom in on the specific complexities involved in developing interesting game mechanics.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Here are the most significant learnings and insights from this project:</p>
        <ol type="1" class="post-text">
          <li><span class="text-highlight">Interesting game mechanics take time polish.</span><p>Creating a simple game mechanic can be quick and easy to implement, however, getting it to a point that is engaging and truly rewarding takes time and polish. With Born Survival we included several game mechanics to highlight the main focus with the powerups, but getting other fundamental pillars like combat, enemy behaviour, and variety would have taken a much longer time to refine and reach an acceptable quality level for an end product.</p></li>
          <li><span class="text-highlight">“Pick 1 of 3” is a great way to add replayability.</span><p>Our main objective proved the hypothesis that even a very simple implementation of a “Pick 1 of 3” mechanic can have notable impacts on user experience. The promise of variety creates a sense of possibilities and drives experimentation and increased engagement by the end user. In Born Survivor this potential was kept purposefuly limited, but with the proper investment on a complete experience this mechanic could have impressive positive results.</p></li>
          <li><span class="text-highlight">Unity’s limitations.</span><p>Unity runs an Update function on every frame for each game object that has a script attached to it. This means that the number of elements on screen can have a significant impact on performance if not handled correctly. Instead of instantiating and destroying scripted game objects (like enemies), the best practice would have been to Pool these objects and reuse them as needed instead of fully destroying them after use.</p></li>
          <li><span class="text-highlight">Coding fundamentals.</span><p>As we dove into more complex mechanics, it became instantly obvious that keeping our code modular and organized is critical to properly maintain and keep improving on other similar project in the future. Frequent code revision and refactoring is a critical task that can’t be overlooked and absolutely needs to be accounted for in our projects’ scope.</p></li>
