Collecting all stickers on a sticker-book or getting a star on an exam I did well in early school are one of the earliest examples I experienced of game-like reward systems in real life.",
    "interests-2": "Understanding how and why certain technologies work is what drove most of my educational decisions and led me to where I am today. One of the biggest questions that I remember having when I was a kid was how a home refrigerator actually worked — it seemed like magic and I needed to understand it. The same happened with gamification systems as I tried to understand the psycology and decision making involved in motivating engagement through clever reward programs.",
    "interests-3": "I’ve been tinkering with computers and software programs since I was a kid. At the age of 11 my parents gave me my first home computer, and a few years later I was already assembling and dissassembling machines and setting up servers for online games.",
    "interests-4": "As you can probably figure out by now, gaming has been a constant interest I’ve kept throughout my life. It started as a way to disconnect from reality, but it evolved into a fascination of how interactive experiences can be purposefully crafted to create unforgettable user experiences. Now that’s my goal — explore and apply creative game-like systems to the right real-life situations.",

    "background-3": "My first job was at an Oil & Gas supplier of compressed gas skids, where my focus was to project manage the entire process from procurement of equipment to the delivery of the assembled units.",
    "background-4": "In an effort to pivot into a more technology-driven career I decided to go back to school and get an MBA. This led me to better understand the motivations behind different business strategies and opened opportunities to leverage my passion for technology in the startup space. This is where I spent most of my professional career working with Customer Loyalty Apps, Software as a Service solutions (SaaS), and implementing internal Customer Resource Management (CRM) systems to align internal processes with the overall company strategy.",
    "background-5": "I only truly understood the transformative potential of gamification systems when I worked with loyalty programs that had a real impact on financial results, and when I saw how internal competitions managed through <a class='link' href='https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/' target='_blank'>CRM software</a> boosted the performance of sales teams.",

    "ai-1": "Being a millenial, I grew up in the early stages of the internet. The only way to find information at the time was through mIRC channels and hidden forums. Since then, the way we access information online evolved quickly from Google searches, Stack Overflow conversations, Youtube tutorial videos, Reddit and other social communities, and now Artificial Intelligence.",
    "ai-2": "What was once a large amount of data publicly available to be consumed by anyone is now diluted by predictive systems that are designed to detect, learn, and re-produce based existing data. While this makes it easier and faster to find information, it also brings worring questions on the way these systems are trained and the future implications they could have.",
    "ai-3": "This is an area that we are all learning from right now. We are truly living in an inflection moment with how powerful and acessible AI tools are becoming. It is undeniable that it is a tool that can’t be ignored.",
    "ai-4": "I’ve learned from personal experience that offloading critical tasks leads to a slippery slope of knowledge retention issues and work quality maintenance. I use AI tools the same way I used Youtube videos, Google searches, and forum deep-dives in the past. It’s a way to review and improve instead of an avenue for creation and decision-making. None of my applications are defined or built by AI tools and prompts, they are only reviewed and improved by carefully planned interfacing with these tools.",

      "objective": "Objective",
      "objective-1": "Flappy Astronaut is the first game I ever created. My initial goal when starting this project was simply to learn the basics of game development, but the main objective was to explore the depths of complexities involved in creating a game experience.",
      "objective-2": "It’s often said that game development is hard. But I only truly understood that after trying to create a simple playable prototype with this project. In order to create an experience that is truly memorable there really is a huge amount of effort required to develop the right game mechanics, design a matching user interface, create complementing art assets, collect quality feedback from user testing, and correctly market the product for release.",
      "objective-3": "The game was inspired by <a class='link' href='https://flappybird.io/' target='_blank'>Flappy Bird</a>, a simple game where you must keep a bird in the air while not touching any of the obstacles. The scope was limited on purpose so I could focus on the process and not the end result.",
      "objective-4": "Although Flappy Astronaut’s game design was heavily based on it’s influence, to achieve the goal set out by the project I decided to give the project it’s own twist. The general setting of the game received it’s own outer space environment, art assets, music, and new mechanics that aligned with the new theme.",
      "concepts": "Core Concepts",
      "concepts-1": "In Flappy Astronaut, the player must guide an astronaut through a field of asteroids while managing their limited supply of oxygen. The end goals is to simply stay alive for as long as possible.",
      "concepts-2": "While flying upwards, the astronaut has to dodge waves of incoming asteroids. These rocks are loosely scattered to provide more opportunities for the player to make quick risk-versus-reward decisions.",
      "concepts-3": "The astronaut is controlled by the user with the keyboard’s space bar. Every press leads to a jet of upward speed that consumes one oxygen tank. The player starts with 15 oxygen tanks and can quickly run out if not managed correctly. Oxygen tanks are scattered around the asteroid field and have to be strategically collected throughout the journey.",
      "concepts-4": "The run ends and the clock stops when the astronaut dies by hitting an asteroid, going below the edges of the screen, or running out of oxygen.",
      "tech": "Tech Stack",
      "tech-1": "This was my first time using a game engine platform. Unity provided the best and most scalable learning platform for this project given it’s initial objectives.",
      "tech-2": "Unreal Engine and Godot were other two great options I could have used as alternatives, with each using a different architecture and programming language. However, Unity was the only that provided but the decision came down to the C# programming language used specifically in Unity.",
      "tech-3": "The primary programming language used in Unity. This was the perfect opportunity to further develop skills in scripting game logic. C# was a great way to build proper foundations learning the principles of modularity, abstraction, and clean code.",
      "tech-4": "Used to create the pixel art presented in the project’s visual design system. The software is the best alternative to Photoshop when it comes to pixel art, and provides great support for animation with layers & frames as separated concepts.",
      "logic": "Game Logic",
      "logic-1": "The logic diagram is a summarized representation of the controlling scripts attached to Unity’s game objects. The simplicity of the game’s scope helped keep the scripts independent and easy to manage. The main complexity of this project was learning how to put it all together in Unity.",
      "logic-2": "Given the learning objective of this project there was no further efforts to organize or condense the project’s files. This is how the assets structure ended up looking like.",
      "logic-3": "Here is a simple snippet from the AsteroidScript.cs with the Update function that Unity runs on every frame. It controls a set of asteroid’s horizontal movement and its destruction when reaching the off-screen threshold (deadZone).",
      "design": "Visual Design System",
      "design-1": "The goal with the visuals of Flappy Astronaut was to define a theme that could align all elements of the game to a single style. The theme of Futuristic Outer-Space was the perfect solution for the flying mechanics, obstacles, and new oxygen survival mechanics.",
      "design-2": "All project sprites were created using Aseprite, and were inspired or mixed with freely available assets from <a class='link' href='https://assetstore.unity.com/' target='_blank'>Unity's Asset Store</a>.",

      "learnings-2": "Here are the most significant learnings and insights from this project:",
      "learnings-li-1": "<span class='text-highlight'>Game development is hard.</span><p>I knew this before starting, but it’s only with practice that we really understand the implication of those words. A quick demo game can be easy to put together, but delivering a properly polished experience can be extremely complex and takes time.</p>",
      "learnings-li-2": "<span class='text-highlight'>Unity Engine is really flexible.</span><p>My biggest surprise was on how easy-to-use and versatile this engine is. I could easily convert the application into an HTML element or a mobile app for both iOS and Android if the project were to evolve in that direction.</p>",
      "learnings-li-3": "<span class='text-highlight'>Visual identity goes a long way.</span><p>Giving the project a design theme really helped to add quality to the end result without much further complexity. The next steps would have been to add better animations and variety to the stage and player interactions.</p>",
      "learnings-li-4": "<span class='text-highlight'>Depth and variety of mechanics.</span><p>Flappy Astronaut had clear boundaries with simple game mechanics and objectives. However, if this project were to evolve beyond just a prototype demo, it would need a variety of additional player challenges, a clearer and more rewarding end-goal, better feedback animations, more stage variations, and difficulty customizations.</p>",
      "learnings-li-5": "<span class='text-highlight'>Coding fundamentals.</span><p>C# provided a great opportunity to revisit and build better coding foundations. Being a Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language, it provided a good refresher on the principles of modularity, abstraction, and clean code.</p>",
