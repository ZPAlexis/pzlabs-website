      "objective-2": "It’s often said that game development is hard. But I only truly understood that after trying to create a simple playable prototype with this project. In order to create an experience that is truly memorable there really is a huge amount of effort required to develop the right game mechanics, design a matching user interface, create complementing art assets, collect quality feedback from user testing, and correctly market the product for release.",

The scope was limited on purpose so I could focus on the process and not the end result.",
      "objective-4": "Although Flappy Astronaut’s game design was heavily based on it’s influence, to achieve the goal set out by the project I decided to give the project it’s own twist. The general setting of the game received it’s own outer space environment, art assets, music, and new mechanics that aligned with the new theme.",

      "concepts-3": "The astronaut is controlled by the user with the keyboard’s space bar. Every press leads to a jet of upward speed that consumes one oxygen tank. The player starts with 15 oxygen tanks and can quickly run out if not managed correctly. Oxygen tanks are scattered around the asteroid field and have to be strategically collected throughout the journey.",

      "learnings-li-2": "<span class='text-highlight'>“Pick 1 of 3” is a great way to add replayability.</span><p>Our main objective proved the hypothesis that even a very simple implementation of a “Pick 1 of 3” mechanic can have notable impacts on user experience. The promise of variety creates a sense of possibilities and drives experimentation and increased engagement by the end user. In Born Survivor this potential was kept purposefuly limited, but with the proper investment on a complete experience this mechanic could have impressive positive results.</p>",
      "learnings-li-3": "<span class='text-highlight'>Unity’s limitations.</span><p>Unity runs an Update function on every frame for each game object that has a script attached to it. This means that the number of elements on screen that has a script can have a significant impact on performance if not handled correctly. Instead of instantiating and destroying scripted game objects (like enemies), the best practice would have been to Pool these objects and reuse them as needed instead of fully destroying them after use.</p>",

      "user-1": "Trofy’s goal of encouraging good habits guided the structure of the user journey. The experience was designed as a positive feedback loop — motivating users to go beyond their goals and return regularly to continue improving.",
      "user-2": "At its core, the app functions like a to-do list, similar to the ones you may have used or created yourself. The biggest difference is the opportunity to fully track past progress, check trends, and provide opportunities for the user to reflect and reprioritize their objectives.",
      "tech": "Tech Stack",
      "tech-1": "Developing a few demo games previously in Unity provided a solid foundation for a gamified app. Unity provided a solid way to develop logic behind constantly animated objects and a seamless solution to port the application to iOS and Android mobile devices.",
      "tech-2": "Csharp is the programming language used in Unity. After learning the foundations of the language, it was refreshing to implement more challenging logic with the notifications controller, save and load systems, and day list managers.",
      "tech-3": "This was also my first time working with AI tools to improve on the code I was writing and to help with more complex logic that was beyond my realm of knowledge. I wrote more details on my use of these tools on the <a class='link' href='#ai'>learnings section</a> and on our <a class='link' href='/about.html'>about page</a>.",
      "logic": "Information Architecture",
      "logic-1": "The core component of  Trofy’s logic system is focused on the Day List objects, it is used and referenced by all main components of the app.",
      "logic-2": "Every objective generates a list of days in a week’s period. This list is then updated by the User Controller through user input, and then accessed by the Date Controller to display today’s applicable objectives and any history of completion on the progress tab.",
      "logic-3": "This is the code that controls the initial generation of a week’s day list from the Objective Controller. Once the initial generated week is completed, the code automatically triggers the generation of additional weeks for the next objective periods.",
      "logic-4": "Another notable area from Trofy’s design is the logic behind the notifications sent by the app. Push notifications are one of the biggest benefits of working with mobile devices. In order to have an engaging and effective experience, it would be crucial to implement a system that provided periodic reminders to the user and motivational messages to bring them back after periods of inactivity.",
      "logic-5": "Trofy’s notifications system was structured with three types of notification schedules:",
      "logic-6": "<span class='text-highlight'>Priority notifications</span><p class='indent'>Reminders on how many days left in a objective that still isn’t complete this week — “This is your last chance to get a 🏆 this week!”.</p>",
      "logic-7": "<span class='text-highlight'>Restart notifications</span><p class='indent'>Reminders on new week starts — “Exercise starts again today, start strong 💪”.</p>",
      "logic-8": "<span class='text-highlight'>Callback notifications</span><p class='indent'>Motivational reminders to bring back the user to the app after many days of inactivity — “Your struggles make you stronger. Your obstacles pave the way for success 💯”.</p>",
      "logic-9": "Another feature worth a highligh was the localization system built for the language switcher. With a simple tap, users can change the app’s language instantly.",
      "logic-10": "The localization system works by replacing text strings based on spreadsheet-style tables that map each interface element to its translation.",
      "design": "Visual Design System",
      "design-1": "The goal with the visuals of Trofy was to make the whole experience feel like the user is playing a game. A “To-do” list is something you go back to checkmark what has been done, in Trofy you return to earn rewards on a game for completing those tasks. All elements used were purposefully choosen to resemble mobile games like Clash of Clans and designs from gamified apps like Duolingo.",
      "design-2": "Trofy’s main character was custom designed and created with Photoshop, while the rest of the UI elements were paid assets acquired from <a class='link' href='https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/gui-pro-casual-game-176695' target='_blank'>Unity’s Asset Store</a>.",
      "wireframe": "Wireframe",
      "wireframe-1": "This is a simple wireframe that helped kick-start the project. The end result is far different than this example, but this process helped organize the information structure required for a better user experience.",
      "roadmap": "MVP Roadmap Structure",
      "roadmap-1": "While this project was built as a test experiement on gamified experiences, the project’s roadmap was structured the same was as if this was a client’s project. The initial v0.1 MVP for Trofy was released for testing in six weeks, but the project stayed in development for a couple more months receiving updates up to v0.4 with the additions of the notification controller and fixes to issues found from user testing.",
      "demo": "Demo & Download",
      "demo-1": "The app is available only on Android devices through an .apk file.",
      "demo-2": "Unfortunately we couldn’t keep the app running on both the iOS and Android stores, as both platforms required frequent updates to keep test apps available.",
      "demo-btn": "Download .APK File",
      "learnings": "Learnings",
      "learnings-1": "This project was the perfect first experiement on gamified applications. It covered all steps from ideation to release of an MVP test version for user testing on both iOS and Android devices. It also highlighted the possibilities of gamified applications through an engine like Unity, and further clarified the effort that would be needed to take this project all the way to a v1.0 release.",
      "learnings-2": "Here are the most significant learnings and insights from this project:",
      "learnings-li-1": "<span class='text-highlight'>Gamified experience potential.</span><p>The experience crafted with the visuals and features of Trofy were a great first step to create a fully gamified experience, but it wasn’t enough. To fully achieve that goal we would need to add support for user-driven competitions and community features for competing and sharing in-app objectives. This would require a significant time investment in structuring backend server structure that would go beyond the initial timeframe allocated for this project.</p>",
      "learnings-li-2": "<span class='text-highlight'>Bridging the gap for a full release.</span><p>This project had a limited scope to ensure we delivered a working MVP that could properly communicate the value proposition envisioned with Trofy. Creating a sense of community with in-app competitions and leaderboards would be the next major pillar of focus before a full app release.</p>",
      "learnings-li-3": "<span class='text-highlight'>Remote backend server support.</span><p>Trofy was developed to run fully locally and had no online functionality, which meant that our backend support was limited to the device’s local storage to function. Proper backend setup with a Node.js server for user authentication, user data storage, and future community features would be the required next steps for a potential full release.</p>",
      "learnings-li-4": "<span class='text-highlight'>Mobile apps with Unity Engine.</span><p>Unity provides one of the best solutions to easily port an application as a native mobile app with iOS Xcode and Android Gradle projects. The process is so smooth that there’s very little code customization required to get the same application from one platform to the other. The only major difference we had to customize in Trofy was the notification system for different trigger structures in each platform.</p>",
      "learnings-li-5": "<span class='text-highlight'>Coding with AI</span><p>This was the first time I started to use Artificial Intelligence tools for my code and it was quite an eye-opening experience. While these tools were great for quickly building more complex code, it quickly became a detriment to how I was able to retain information and re-apply it again in other similar situations. Since then I’ve scaled back the usage of the tool so it is purely educational and for situations that I’m truly stuck for longer periods of time. There’s a full statement on my usage of AI on our <a class='link' href='/about.html#ai'>about page.</a></p>",
