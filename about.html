        <h1 class="about-text-title">Interests</h1>
        <p class="about-text-description">As a self-proclaimed certified nerd, the intersection between game mechanics and real life is something that fascinated me ever since I was a kid. Getting a sticker when you did well on an exam in early school is one of the earliest examples I can think of a simple game-like reward system applied to real life. Loyalty reward systems are also great examples of tried-and-proven gamified systems that strongly engage customers. My goal is to explore and apply creative game-like mechanics and systems to the right real-life situation.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">Understanding how and why certain technologies work is what drove most of my educational decisions and led me to where I am today. One of the biggest questions that I remember having when I was a kid was how a home refrigerator actually worked - it seemed like magic and I needed to understand it.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">I’ve been tinkering with computers and software programs since I was a kid. At the age of 11 my parents gave me my first home computer, and a few years later I was already assembling and dissassembling machines and setting up servers for online games.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">Gaming is also one of the constant interests I’ve kept throughout my life. It started as a way to disconnect from reality, but it evolved into a fascination of how interactive experiences can be purposefully crafted to create unforgettable user experiences.</p>

        <h1 class="about-text-title">Background</h1>
        <p class="about-text-description">I've worked with a variety of small and medium sized businesses and interfaced with many different types of revenue-generating teams.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">Most of my career focus was influenced by my Process Engineering degree, where I leveraged my ability to understand complex processes and re-align them to new business strategies.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">My first job was at an Oil & Gas supplier of compressed gas skids, where my focus was to project manage the entire process from procurement of equipment to the delivery of the assembled units.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">In an effort to pivot into a more technology-driven career I decided to go back to school and get a Masters in Business Administration (MBA). This led me to better understand the motivations behind different business strategies and opened opportunities to leverage my passion for technology in the startup space. This is where I spent most of my professional career working with Customer Loyalty Apps, Software as a Service solutions (SaaS), and implementing internal Customer Resource Management (CRM) systems to align internal processes with the overall company strategy.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">I only truly understood the transformative potential of gamification systems when I interfaced with effective loyalty programs that elevated small businesses to the next level, and while seeing the impact on sales teams performance when running internal competitions through <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/">CRM software</a> applications.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">The possibilities for gamification of real life and work situations are endless. Technology is only becoming more and more accessble. This the perfect time to start leveraging digital solutions to motivate real-life consequences.</p>

        <h1 class="about-text-title">A disclosure on how I use AI</h1>
        <p class="about-text-description">Being a millenial, I grew up in the early stages of the internet. The only way to find information at the time was through mIRC channels and hidden community forums. Since then, the way we access information online evolved quickly from Google searches, Stack Overflow conversations, Youtube tutorial videos, Reddit and other social communities, and now Artificial Intelligence — or AI.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">What was once a large amount of data publicly available to be consumed by anyone is now diluted by predictive systems that are designed to detect, learn, and re-produce based existing data. While this makes it easier and faster to find some information, it also brings extremely worring questions on the way these systems were trained and the future implications they could have.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">This is an area that we are all learning from right now. We are truly living in an inflection moment with how powerful and acessible AI tools are becoming. It is undeniable that it is a tool that can’t be ignored.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">I’ve learned from personal experience that offloading critical tasks leads to a slippery slope of knowledge retention issues and work quality maintenance. I use AI tools the same way I used Youtube videos, Google searches, and forum deep-dives in the past. It’s a way to review and improve instead of an avenue for creation and decision-making. None of my applications are defined or built by AI tools and prompts, they are only reviewed and improved by carefully planned interfacing with these tools.</p>
        <p class="about-text-description">I wanted to personally thank you for taking the time to read this far, and I’m very interested to know your opinion on these topics. Feel free to reach out with your thougts over by email!</p>
